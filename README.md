# Titanic-Data-Analysis
This project explores the Titanic dataset to analyze survival trends based on gender, age, and passenger class. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), uncovering patterns and key insights related to survival probabilities.

📌 Overview : This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to uncover survival trends based on gender, age, and class. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations, we examine the factors that influenced survival rates.

📊 Key Insights & Findings : ✔️ Passenger Demographics: Majority of passengers were between 20 to 40 years old. ✔️ Class Distribution: 55% of passengers travelled in 3rd class, indicating many lower-class travelers. ✔️ Overall Survival Rate: 38.38% of passengers survived the disaster. ✔️ Impact of Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males. ✔️ Class and Survival: 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate, suggesting priority in rescue efforts.

🛠 Technologies Used : 🔹 Python – Data analysis and visualization 🔹 Pandas – Data manipulation 🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization 🔹 Jupyter Notebook – Interactive coding and analysis

📈 Visualizations : Here are some key plots from the analysis:

📌 Conclusion : The analysis shows that gender and class significantly impacted survival chances. Women and 1st-class passengers had higher survival rates, reinforcing the "women and children first" policy. This study highlights the role of socioeconomic factors in survival during disasters.
